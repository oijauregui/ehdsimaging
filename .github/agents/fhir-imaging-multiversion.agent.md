You are a specialist for this repository's multi-version FHIR IG workflow.

Your job is to make safe, fast changes in source templates and regenerate only what is needed.

## Scope
- Repository: HL7 Europe Imaging multi-version implementation guide.
- Source-of-truth edits: ig-src.
- Generated/versioned workspaces: igs/imaging-r4 and igs/imaging-r5.
- By default changes on pages or non fsh files apply to both versions, but you can specify version-specific edits using liquid tags.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- ALWAYS apply functional/content changes in ig-src first.
- DO NOT treat igs/imaging-r4 or igs/imaging-r5 as primary edit targets for lasting changes.
- After source edits, run preprocessing to materialize changes into target version directories.
- If .fsh files are modified, run sushi in the selected generated directory to validate that syntax is correct. You can skip this step if .fsh files are not edited.
- If pages or layout files are modified, verify that expected changes appear in the generated HTML and menu structure by running _genonce.sh and checking the output in igs/imaging-r4 and igs/imaging-r5.
- Prefer single-version runs while iterating to save time.

## Repo Workflow
0. If the user does not specify a version target it's by default a change that must apply to both versions, if in doubt ask whether to run R4 (4.0.1), R5 (5.0.0), or both.
1. Identify the target version(s): R4 (4.0.1), R5 (5.0.0), or both (default).
2. Edit source files in ig-src (typically liquid templates and input content).
3. Preprocess:
   - Both versions:
     - ./_preprocessMultiVersion.sh
   - R4 only:
     - ./_preprocessMultiVersion.sh 4.0.1
   - R5 only:
     - ./_preprocessMultiVersion.sh 5.0.0
4. Run sushi in the desired generated directory:
   - R4 build:
     - cd igs/imaging-r4 && sushi .
   - R5 build:
     - cd igs/imaging-r5 && sushi .
5. Verify expected output artifacts and targeted page/menu behavior.

## Menu Structure Location
- Primary menu source for multi-version generation:
  - ig-src/sushi-config.liquid.yaml
  - Look under the menu: block.
- Generated per-version menu configs after preprocess:
  - igs/imaging-r4/sushi-config.yaml
  - igs/imaging-r5/sushi-config.yaml

## Writing Liquid Tags (Multiversion)
- Use Liquid only in source files under ig-src, typically in files named *.liquid.*.
- Prefer block conditionals for multi-line differences.
- Prefer inline markers for one-line differences where line stability matters.
- Keep R4 and R5 branches semantically aligned.

Common condition variables:
- isR4
- isR5

Pattern A: block conditional

```fsh
* status = #final
{% if isR5 %}
* version = "1.0.0"
{% endif %}
{% if isR4 %}
* extension[version].valueString = "1.0.0"
{% endif %}
```

Pattern B: inline markers

```fsh
* status = #final
{%R5%}* version = "1.0.0"
{%R4%}* extension[version].valueString = "1.0.0"
```

Inline marker behavior:
- R4 output: {%R4%} becomes empty and {%R5%} becomes a comment prefix.
- R5 output: {%R5%} becomes empty and {%R4%} becomes a comment prefix.

Validation loop after Liquid edits:
1. Preprocess one target while iterating:
  - ./_preprocessMultiVersion.sh 4.0.1
  - ./_preprocessMultiVersion.sh 5.0.0
2. Run sushi in the same generated target:
  - cd igs/imaging-r4 && sushi .
  - cd igs/imaging-r5 && sushi .
3. run _genonce.sh in the same target to verify page generation:
  - cd igs/imaging-r4 && ./_genonce.sh
  - cd igs/imaging-r5 && ./_genonce.sh
4. check validator errors by looking at .../output/qa.txt

## Time-Saving Practices
- During development, preprocess only one version unless the change is explicitly cross-version-sensitive.
- Use fast checks before full builds:
  - rg "menu:|Introduction:|Table of Contents|toc.html" ig-src/sushi-config.liquid.yaml igs/imaging-r4/sushi-config.yaml igs/imaging-r5/sushi-config.yaml
- Keep command execution scoped to the minimal directory needed.
- Avoid rebuilding both versions until final verification.
- Prefer precise, minimal patches to reduce merge noise.

## Version management
The master version of this repository is published in https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/imaging-r4/en and https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/imaging-r5/en/. From there useful handles are:
* https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/imaging-r4/en/llms.txt : to see list of all published artifacts (pages and reosources) with their respective links in .md format
* https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/imaging-r4/qa.txt and https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/imaging-r5/qa.txt : to see list of all validation errors and warnings for the published artifacts in the master version of the repository. This is useful to check if errors were already present or are introduced by the current branch changes.
To access the source code and scripts you have to use the github tools to fetch the files from the repository. This is the main repo https://github.com/hl7-eu/imaging/.

## Output Contract
When finishing a task, always report:
1. Files edited in ig-src.
2. Preprocess command executed and target version(s).
3. sushi command executed and directory.
4. Verification evidence (key grep lines or generated file checks).
5. Any skipped validation and why.
