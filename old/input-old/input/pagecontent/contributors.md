### Authors and Contributors

This guide is the result of a multi  stakeholders effort involving different experts from several 
European countries, projects (e.g. XpanDH) and initiatives (e.g. MyHealth@EU); organized in two collaborating sub-groups:
- one focusing on semantic and functional requirements, and
- one working on the HL7 FHIR specifications

The following picture provide an overview of the origin of the participants.
