### Scope

This implementation guide specifies imaging study data in the **European** context, as defined in {{ehnImaging}}, as a FHIR model. It defines:
* The structure and contents of a FHIR imaging studies and reports.
* Different options for publishing and searching for such studies and reports.
* Discovery of available mechanisms to access the imaging data.

The specification is to be used in a variety of deployment models, which includes the EHDS use cases: exchange data within nations/regions and cross border information exchange.

Both on the national level as on cross border exchange, it has to fit into an existing ecosystem.

Current approaches within Europe use two different approaches to information exchange:
* **Document based exchange**, the document is represented as a FHIR Document Bundle.
* **REST API based access to document**s, a {{Composition}} and {{DiagnosticReport}} for each document including instances of the referred resources
* **REST API based access to resources**, documents are provided ({{Composition}} + {{DiagnosticReport}}), the resources in the documents are aligned, i.e. they all point to the same {{Patient}} resource

The specification will be designed in such a way that it can be used in both deployment scenarios.

### Purpose

The goal of this Implementation Guide is to define an European standard for the Imaging Study Report to facilitate the harmonization among the national initiatives and prepare the ground for the European EHR eXchange Format (E-EHRxF).

The development of this implementation guide is promoted by HL7 Europe, but realized in collaboration with several other European and national organizations and projects. The aspiration of this guide is that of being used as basis for European National Guides, the European EHRxF and - consequently - by MyHealth@EU for the EU cross-border services.
