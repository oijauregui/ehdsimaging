### Composition structure

One of the choices made in the IG is the structure of the Composition resource. Multiple approaches to defining the structure exists. The ones considered are:

* Leave it open for users of the implementation guide.
* Follow the structure of the presented form (rendered document).
* Follow the structure of the {{ehnImagingGuidelines}}.
* Adopt the structure defined in IHE-IDR.

Linking the structure of the composition of the presented form will cause difficulties as it requires importers of such documents to understand and properly represent such structure which might place undue burden on such import process.

Consistency in rendering of radiology reports will make it easier for healthcare professionals to locate and understand the important sections. Based on that rationale, this specification will define a required structure.

Regarding the structure to support, this implementation guide taps into earlier work on that topic, i.e. IHE-IDR, and will adopt the suggested section division defined in the preliminary specification.
