## Proposed Dispositions

### Disposition A: Accept As Requested

#### Proposal

Review this ticket with the work group to determine if the requested change should be accepted and implemented exactly as described.

#### Justification

The ticket is in status Triaged and presents a specific change request. Work group review is needed to make an informed decision on whether this approach is feasible and aligns with specification goals.

---

### Disposition B: Alternative Approach

#### Proposal

Address the underlying need of the ticket through an alternative mechanism or different approach that differs from what was literally requested.

#### Justification

Alternative approaches may better align with existing patterns, minimize implementation burden, or provide better long-term maintainability while still addressing the ticket's core concern.

---

### Disposition C: Decline

#### Proposal

Decline the request with clear rationale (e.g., out of scope, insufficient use cases, already addressed by existing mechanism, breaking change not justified).

#### Justification

Declining may be appropriate if the change would introduce unnecessary complexity, conflict with design principles, or if existing mechanisms already address the need.
